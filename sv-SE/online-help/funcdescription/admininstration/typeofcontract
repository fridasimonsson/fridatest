# Order ways

> Prerequisites: Access attributes 4901-4906


Supplier agreements must be set up and configured in terms of conditions and supplier before requisitions can be created. The products ([items]((https://github.com/cajsaahlinder/cajsatest/blob/master/en/online-help/buyer/items.md))) covered by the agreement are also linked to the order way.

Order ways can be searched for according to:
* Alternatives
	* The “Hidden only” option displays only those which have the “Hide for users” box checked under the “General” tab.
* Validity
	* All active (all agreements which have not been archived)
	* Expired only (where the “Valid to” date has passed (“Agreement” tab))
	* Current only
	* Future only (where the “Valid from” date has not yet passed (“Agreement” tab))
* Archived
* Group (agreements which are assigned to a selected group)

You can use the ”Change user” button to assign the agreement to a group or users. Supplier agreements are shown with their name under available agreements (Supplier name -> General tab; Field ”Supplier name”).


Supplier agreements can be integrated from Visma TendSign. These supplier agreements are updated and added to Visma Proceedo overnight. The TendSign integration setup is administered by Visma Commerce AB.

The register of supplier agreements is common to the whole setup, which is why the settings that are configured will generally apply to all organisations when they use the same agreements. 

Every supplier agreement is created using all the parameters. No template agreement is created for a supplier agreement as in the case of an organisation and invoice supplier. 

A supplier agreement is never deleted, but only archived. After archiving, it can only be copied to a new supplier agreement. When copying agreements, links to agreements, agreement attachments or the items will not be copied to the new supplier agreement. 

A supplier agreement contains details about the supplier. But this is the agreement supplier and must not be mixed up with the invoice supplier, who is the supplier that issues the invoice. 

If you click on the i button while a requisition is being registered (Procurement -> Create requisition), you will see the screen below when looking at a supplier agreement. The content on the screen comes from the fields which are marked with “i” when you create a supplier agreement. The supplier information appears on the left of the screen and agreement information on the right. An end user who has the appropriate role also has an option to insert comments on the screen for the agreement owner. The comments will be sent to the agreement owner if an e-mail address is specified under Administration -> Supplier agreements -> Agreement tab. Otherwise, the comment is saved in the supplier agreement under Administration -> Supplier agreements -> Texts tab.


### New/Change agreement <a name="new"/>

A new agreement can be created or changes can be made to existing ones by selecting the buttons “Copy”, “Change” or “New”.

Agreements can also be imported via Excel Import/Export. The fields descriptions for this are in the Excel file which is generated during the export operation using the Export/Import button at the bottom right of the screen.

#### General tab <a name="general"/>

**Name***

This field is mandatory and is the name displayed in lists of supplier agreements. It does not need to be unique (the unique key for the agreement is an External ID). There may be several agreements with the same supplier, but they have different External IDs. If it starts with PID, it is set automatically by Visma Proceedo. Otherwise, it is created via integration from TendSign. Visma TendSign offers administrators an option for specifying a trade name for a supplier in the agreement. If a trade name is used in Visma TendSign, this name will be mapped to the “Supplier name” field in Visma Proceedo.


**Hide for users** Y/N

The supplier agreement linked to users can be made invisible by marking the agreement as hidden. The supplier agreement is then highlighted in black under Administration -> Supplier agreements. This can be used, for instance, if you have received information about the supplier becoming insolvent and do not want the users to make new requisitions with this supplier.

**Other description** (i)

This is information text for the end user/orderer.

**Search words** (i)

Up to 3500 characters can be used for each search term and they can be input with or without spaces. This is used to find supplier agreements.

**Branch**

**UNSPCS version**

**VAT rate**

Default VAT rate used when creating new items.

The VAT rate can also be set individually by item and will then override the VAT rate specified in the supplier agreement. This VAT rate is used when creating invoices on the Visma Proceedo Supplier Portal. The VAT rate can, if necessary, be amended by the supplier when generating invoices on the Supplier Portal.




##### Supplier Basic information 

**Organisation number**

Supplier organisation number.


**VAT number**

Supplier’s VAT number.

**Country**

This is only for show as the information does not control anything in Visma Proceedo. **VERIFY IF THIS IS TRUE? NOT USED IN VAT AUTOMATION?**


##### Supplier address


##### Helpdesk contact

**Phone**, **e-mail** and **fax** is possible to specify and it they are presented to the users in order for them to directly contact the supplier


##### Supplier contact 

**Name**, **phone**, **mobile** and **e-mail** is available to specify and they are presented to users in case of more specific questions arise or helpdesk contact details is not available. 


##### Order information


##### Order processing 

**Allow requisition approval bypass** Y/N

You use this to specify whether the end user can, under the contract, send an order to a supplier without the requisition being approved (approved beforehand). You need to have a role linked to access attribute 5776.

**Warn on repeat purchase** Y/N

If this option is marked, the end user will receive a warning confirming that he/she is ordering an item where there are already requisitions for the same item (for the same user), but their delivery has not been confirmed. The warning indicates the relevant items. You can choose to ignore the warning and continue with the requisition.

**Automatic delivery confirmation** Y/N

This is used if all order deliveries from the supplier are to be confirmed automatically. You can also select automatic delivery confirmation by item.


**Minimum order value**

When a requisition is made, if the total order value for the supplier is less than this value a pop-up warning is displayed (fixed text - cannot be amended). The orderer decides whether to still create the requisition.

**Comment to goods receiver** Do not show/ When required/ Should be assigned

This specifies whether it is possible to add a comment with the delivery confirmation. This information is not sent to the supplier; it is only shown in Visma Proceedo.

**Customer number** 

This will show the agreement’s customer number for the supplier. This number is printed on the order to the supplier. If the company/organisation using Visma Proceedo has several customer numbers for the supplier, one customer number per organisation can be input under Administration -> Advanced -> Organisation. The details input under [“Org. settings”](https://github.com/cajsaahlinder/cajsatest/blob/master/en/online-help/buyer/orderways.md#orgsettings) override what features in the “Customer number” field.





##### Sending of order



##### External webshop <a name="externalshop"/>



##### Order copy

##### Order response

**Expect order response** (i) Y/N

This indicates that an order is awaiting confirmation from the supplier.
The order’s status will be “Awaiting order response” if this option is ticked. Otherwise, it will be ”Not
confirmed”.
If there is no order response, the order can be approved manually. You can create a manual order
response, but without making any amendments by selecting the “Order response” tab under
Procurement -> Delivery confirmation.

**Allow orderless response** Y/N

An order response can be imported without the need for an underlying order. This allows a supplier to
register an order response without an underlying order. Visma Proceedo generates an order based on
the order response.

**Auto-approve** None/All/All without changes

All without changes means that if an order response matches an order, the order will be automatically
approved. If the order response is approved it is ready for delivery confirmation. Its status will be “Not
confirmed”. The order responses which differ from the order will need to be approved by the orderer.
No feedback will be given to the supplier when the orderer has approved the order response.
All means that the orderer needs to approve all the order responses, including those which match the
order 100%.
None means that Visma Proceedo approves all order responses, regardless of whether they update
the order with amendments or not.

“Order match settings” tab (Administration -> Organisation).

**Order match settings**

These are the same settings displayed under the organisation settings. They apply to the whole
organisation, but can be amended for the supplier agreement.

if the supplier agreement is integrated with a market agreement, the following fields also appear under
the tab:

### Supplier tab (Supplier agreements)

By selecting this field you can link the supplier agreement to a market supplier. In order to become a
market supplier, the supplier must be invited to register. Suppliers with several agreements and/or customers then have a single login to the Visma Proceedo Supplier Portal for generating invoices,
importing catalogues etc. to all their customers.

Market suppliers are invited under Administration -> Advanced -> Market supplier. If you click the
“View card” button, the market supplier’s details are displayed.
Numerous supplier agreements can be linked to the same market supplier. When you have selected
the market supplier, the following question will be displayed under the tab giving you the option to
copy the address which is specified in the market agreement so that it is then noted in your supplier
agreement.

**Goods mark**

Use these settings if you require a goods mark on the order to specify the rules during order registration. Depending on which options are marked, this specifies whether a goods mark will be used or not. There is space for specifying a goods mark under the “Comments” field.

**Structured comment**

This option allows you to indicate additional information to the supplier during the order process by creating headings or queries which the orderer must provide information for. The information is then input by the end user in the dialogue under “Information to supplier” during order registration.

See also Chapter 42 for a description of how this field is used.

Fields 1-4 (i)

There are four free text fields available for you to mention any additional information about the agreements. This information is displayed when an agreement is listed while requisitions are being created, and it can also be used in reports. The information which should be input in the fields is specified under Administration -> Advanced -> Customer data -> Procurement tab; “Heading Fields 1-4” field.





### Items tab (Supplier agreements)

The items/services to be provided under the agreement must be set up under the “Items” tab. In order to make the “Items” tab visible, the supplier must first be saved. The maximum number of items that can be processed directly in Visma Proceedo is 1,000. Items can be imported via an Excel template using the “Export/Import” button.


**Marketplace supplier Market agreement**

If the supplier is a market supplier, you can create a market agreement for the supplier under Administration -> Advanced -> Market agreement. This field specifies the market agreement which applies to the supplier agreement.

The market agreement can be amended using the “Configure” button or via administration of the market agreement (Administration -> Advanced -> Market agreement).

One market agreement is always linked to one supplier agreement (not to several). See section 9.3 for more about setting up/amending items.

**Agreement validity from date**
 
The start date of the agreement. All connections to groups and users can be prepared before this date without the agreement being visible to users. The “Active supplier agreement date” option determines
whether the agreement date will control access for end users. If Y is selected for the “Active supplier
agreement date” option under Administration -> Advanced -> Customer data; Procurement tab,
the agreement will not be visible to the end user before this date.

**Agreement validity to date**

The end date of the agreement. Connections to groups and users can be kept without the users being
able to create requisitions or view the agreement after this date. The “Active supplier agreement date”
option determines whether the agreement date will control access for end users. If Y is selected for the
“Active supplier agreement date” option under “Customer data”; “Procurement” tab, the agreement will
not be visible to the end user after this date.

**Extension possible to**

This is used simply to help procurers so that they know when a new agreement must be signed. For example, an agreement can be signed for 3 years with the option to extend it by 2 years. The last possible date for the agreement is then specified here.

**Original agreement end date**

This is used to indicate the date that was the original agreement end date to clarify how long the agreement can be extended. For example, if the text only says that the agreement can be extended by 2 years, it is important to know from which date these 2 years apply. “From Date” and “To Date“ are simply the dates that determine whether an agreement is visible to end users.

**Send reminder** Y/N

You set this to “Yes” if you want reminders to be sent according to the settings under “Message notification (Customer data)” when a Supplier agreement expires. The setting that has been specified under “Message notification” is the default for all agreements and setting this parameter to N overrides this for the supplier agreement.

under Customer data. If you select Administration -> Advanced -> Customer data -Advanced ->
General tab, the Org. no., DUNS number etc. used by default as envelope recipient appear at the
bottom left of the screen.



Real time export
Under “Real time export” you can create rules for exporting files. See the description under Customer
data, Chapter 39.
The relevant settings are available under “Customer data”; “Other” tab - and under “Organisation”;
“Procurement” tab.

**Allow import of order copy** Y/N

Order copy is used to mean an order which has not been registered in Visma Proceedo. This parameter enables the company to import purchase orders for the agreement which have been generated in a way other than via Visma Proceedo.
