# Import contracts

From the menu "Contracts" you reach the function for importing Contracts. One or several contracts can be imported manually from an Excel file, using a guide in several steps. A template "Excel template for contracts import" is available to download where you can enter the contracts you want to import. You then follow the guide's steps to upload the file and import the contracts:

1. Upload file, the file is uploaded and validated.
2. Map fields, any fields in the file that could not be mapped automatically are mapped here manually.
3. Preview contracts, the contracts in the file are validated and reviewed and any errors are presented. The import can be cancelled to correct errors (and then perform a new import).
4. Summary, a summary of the number of imported contracts and suppliers is presented. Via a link, you can go on to the Search contract page where the imported contracts have been filtered out and displayed directly in the contract list.
