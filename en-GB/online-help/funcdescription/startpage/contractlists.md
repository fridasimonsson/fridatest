# Contract lists

On the start page of Visma CA contracts are grouped in different ways and displayed in lists. The contracts in the lists can be bookmarked as favorites by clicking on the star placed adjacent to each contract’s name. The Contract overview page is opened if you click on any of the contracts in the lists.

#### Lists displayed
* New contracts
  * Lists the first ten contracts with Active status where contract start date is today or later, sorted by contract start date, oldest first.

* New contracts we can call off
  * Lists the ten last updated contracts where current user's organisation has been added as call off organisation, sorted by last updated date, the latest updated at the top of the list. The list will not be shown on the start page if the organisation does not have any contracts to call off from.

* Drafts
  * Lists all contracts with Draft status, sorted in alphabetical order by contract name.

* Bookmarked contracts
  * Lists all contracts that have been bookmarked, sorted in alphabetical order by contract name.

* Just expired
