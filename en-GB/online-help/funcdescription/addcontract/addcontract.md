# Add contract

From the menu "Contracts" you reach the function for adding contracts, where you must first make a choice of supplier. You can search for the supplier by name or organisation number (or parts of these). You can also leave the search field blank and click on the search symbol and a list of all suppliers is displayed. The supplier list is sorted alphabetically. When a supplier is selected, a draft contract is created and it is displayed on the Contract overview page in edit mode, so that information about the contract can be entered immediately. If you cancel the change mode, the draft contract will be deleted.
