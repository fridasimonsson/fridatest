# Edit and delete contract

In the upper section on the contract there is an Edit-button. When it is clicked the contract is displayed in edit mode and the contract details can be edited and saved. Editing can be performed on pages Overview, Business parties and Documents. All changes of contract details are saved and version managed and it is possible to add own version comments every time a change is saved. This is done via a link that appears in the upper section of the contract when you are in the edit mode.

When you are in the edit mode, it is also possible to delete the contract completely using a button at the bottom of the page. Then the contract is deleted from Visma CA.

If it is a contract where the organisation of the logged in user only has the right to call off, the contract cannot be changed or deleted.
